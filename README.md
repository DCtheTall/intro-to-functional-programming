### LISP functions

After having recently read [An Introduction to Functional Programming Through Lambda Calculus](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Functional-Programming-Calculus-Mathematics/dp/0486478831),
I was inspired to publish my solutions to the last problem set written in LISP.

I recommend this read for any programmer who is curious about what functional programming
and lambda calculus is all about. It's an approachable but still rigorous introduction
to the concepts of functional programming.

The solutions are divided into:
- Arithmetic functions
- Functions for generic lists such as search, replace, and concat
- Functions for compound data structures using lists
- Binary search tree functions such as search, compare, inorder, and invert
